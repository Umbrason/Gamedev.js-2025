Balance tips:
* AI is not building enough combiners:
	=> increase combined resources base and base production utilities
* AI is building too much and not pledging enough
	=> increase base utility and/or reduce base production
	=> Increase production impact so building more than a few buildings of each type will have low utility
* AI is not focusing enough on producing resources for goals:
	=> Increase goal progress factors X
	Y should be left at 1 for basic resources, and at a small negative value for combined resources (no need to produce more if the goal is almost reached)
* Evil AI is too obvious:
	=> Reduce Selfish Goal weight
* AI is too strong / rational:
	=> Increase Noise Strength



Combined resources utility should be at least 3 times basic resources utility because crafting one combined resource uses 2 basic ones.

"ResourcesUtilityEstimator2 Petition" has high basic resources base production with high production impact so AI will try to get one basic building of each type before advanced buildings.
